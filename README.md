# Bucket // 
#### Solo Project for Prime Digital Academy

Have you ever had someone recommend a place to you, only for you to write it down and lose the note, forgetting what they told you to try? This application aims to solve the issue of gathering these recommendations from friends and family when you are traveling or moving to a new location. One side acts as a rapid log of events and locations To Visit, where you can add the address, type of event, and what the person recommended. You can then check these items off your list, add your own feedback, and then move this to the Visited section, which acts as a memory log, and allows a user to check back if they want to visit a location again. 

## Getting Started

Clone or download this repository to get started using Bucket //.

### Prerequisites & Installing

To get started using Bucket, you will need to make sure you have the latest versions of MongoDB, mongoose, Angular.js, Node.js, Express.js, and Angular Material. To download these or make sure you are up to date, open terminal, navigate to the folder containing the Bucket // app and type:

```
npm install
```

This will automatically install all the dependencies the application has. To start and run the application, type:

```
npm start
```

And navigate to localhost:5000. 
Voila! You are now able to use Bucket //!

Try adding a new place by clicking on the yellow + button at the bottom of the To Visit view to see how a place can be quickly added to your Bucket list.
